								<h2><a href="#">Cloud Resume Challenge</a></h2>
		
									Discovered this challenge while exploring practical projects to engage with, aiming to enhance and apply cloud skills and principles.Before this, I had successfully acquired my AWS Cloud practicer certification and was actively pursing Associate-level certifications.Moreover, I boasted several years of experience as an IT support Analyst II.

									<h3>Certification</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Add link to certification here.<P></P>
									This challenge requires a cert and i already had one.
								</p>
									<h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
							Began this phase of the project by acquiring a simple HTML template along with it's corresponding CSS stylesheet.Through various adjustments to tags and references, i iteratively arrived ath the current layout of the website.
							<h3>Static website, HTTPS, DNS</h3>
							Utilizing the AWS Management Console, I established an S3 bucket and activated static hosting. Additionally, I procured a custom domain (Olaolu-resume.com) via Route 53. For enhanced security, I generated an SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager to enable HTTPS. To ensure optimal content delivery, I established a CloudFront distribution and configured custom DNS routing through Route 53 to direct to the custom DNS.
							<p></p>
							<h3>DynamoDB Database, API and Python</h3>

								</p>
								<h3>Source Control & CI/CD</h3>
								This part introduced me to the utilization of GitHub repository and GitHub actions. To eliminate the need for manual code uploads to the S3 bucket,  I successfully set up a GitHub repository and configured a workflow that automatically synced commit from local website code to GitHub repository, and subsequently to S3 bucket on AWS.
<p></p>
								Local website code > GitHub repository > AWS S3 Bucket

								<h3> Final Notes</h3>
								Overall, I think the resume challenge is a good experience. Engaging in this project has undeniably proven to be an enriching and valuable experience.
								I enjoyed using the various cloud concepts and technology and relating them together to create a final product.
								The process of working this practical project using AWS services gives strong desire to further refine my skills and expand my knowledge by taking more ambitious and intricate projects in the future.
